Gatoclient Rewritten is a totally new client based on what I learned since making the original client. I've worked to fix many of my issues and built on top of what other clients of today bring to the table.

If you don't want a feature, you don't have to run it because it won't be installed in the client. Instead, you can open the Krunker Social Page and download addons from the Gatoclient Addon Store. This ensures that you won't be slowed down by features you don't want to use.

If you would like to support me, consider following me on my socials:
