Gatoclient is a Krunker client created and managed by creepycats.
(This was all made by just one developer. Keep that in mind)

### THIS IS OUTDATED SOURCE CODE. CONSIDER USING PREPACKAGED SETUP
Gatoclient is built using the same technique as IDKR uses, even though Gatoclient is a totally separate client

You first need to install the source code.

In the GatoclientElectron folder, open Command prompt / Powershell and run the command
```sh
npm install
```
This will install the dependencies. From there, if you want to just run Gatoclient from source, run
```sh
npm start
```
Or if you want to build it, you run
```sh
npm run dist
```
